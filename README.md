# WebDev Homepage

Welcome to my Webdev 2017 Homepage!

I am Sai Sujitha, a 3rd year undergraduate at Northeastern University from Singapore. I am currently pursuing a BS in
Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Operations at Northeastern University. I had previously developed a
web-app called PrintOnTheGo at hackMIT using Javascript, Html, CSS and Google Maps API. The functionality of the web-app
 was to locate the user and find out the nearest available printer on Campus and to send notifications to the
 maintenance team when a printer stopped working. The purpose of this repository is for the summer 1 2017 WebDev class.
